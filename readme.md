📘 LeetCode Daily Python

A collection of my daily LeetCode solutions written in Python.
This repository serves as my personal coding journal where I practice algorithms, data structures, and interview patterns—one problem at a time.

🚀 Goals

Solve at least one LeetCode problem every day

Improve problem-solving and coding speed

Learn patterns (sliding window, DP, BFS/DFS, backtracking, etc.)

Build a consistent study habit

🧠 What You’ll Find Here

✔ Clean, readable Python solutions

✔ Categorized problems (Arrays, DP, Graphs, etc.)

✔ Solutions grouped by difficulty (Easy / Medium / Hard)

✔ Occasionally added explanations / comments

✔ File naming with problem number + title for easy lookup
